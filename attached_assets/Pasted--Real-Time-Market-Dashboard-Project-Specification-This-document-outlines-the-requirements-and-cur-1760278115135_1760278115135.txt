📈 Real-Time Market Dashboard Project Specification

This document outlines the requirements and current implementation status for a modular, customizable web dashboard designed for real-time market monitoring and external webhook integration.
I. Project Goal

To deliver a single-file, responsive React application using Tailwind CSS and Firebase Firestore that provides users with a persistent, drag-and-drop dashboard for monitoring live cryptocurrency market data (via WebSocket APIs) and receiving and processing external messages (simulated webhooks).
II. Core Features (Current Status)

The following features have been implemented and validated in the Dashboard.jsx file:

Feature
	

Implementation Details
	

Status

Real-Time Data Streams
	

Connects directly to public WebSocket APIs (Binance, Bybit, OKX) for spot ticker data (price/volume). Includes automatic reconnection and Bybit ping/pong heartbeat logic.
	

Complete

Modular Layout
	

Dashboard uses a responsive grid layout. Widgets can be added, removed, and reordered via a basic drag-and-drop mechanism.
	

Complete

Persistent Configuration
	

Widget layout, exchange/symbol settings, and alert rules are automatically saved and loaded using Firebase Firestore (scoped to the current user ID).
	

Complete

Configurable Sources
	

Users can configure the exchange (Binance/Bybit/OKX) and symbol (e.g., BTCUSDT) for each Market Data widget via a sliding configuration panel.
	

Complete

Simulated Webhooks
	

Includes a dedicated widget and "Simulate Receive" button to inject mock webhook messages into the stream and log.
	

Complete

Alert Management
	

Supports configurable Keyword Alerts (for webhooks) and Price Condition Alerts (for market data, e.g., > 65000).
	

Complete

UI/Aesthetics
	

Clean, dark-themed, and fully responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

III. Next Steps (Feature Enhancements)

The following features are required to complete the project vision:

    Market Data Granularity:

        Goal: Enhance the Market Data Widget to display more granular data than just the current price and 24h volume.

        Requirement: Add support for viewing Level 2 Order Book Depth (Top 5 Bids/Asks) in a separate widget or expand the existing one. This requires subscribing to the appropriate WebSocket channel (e.g., depth5 or diff.depth).

    Visualizations:

        Goal: Introduce a chart widget to display historical price movement.

        Requirement: Create a new widget that visualizes K-Line (Candlestick) data using a library like D3.js or a simple SVG rendering to plot the last 100 closing prices received from the market stream.

    Enhanced Notifications (External):

        Goal: Provide a way to push real alerts externally (currently, alerts are only displayed in the Alerts Log widget).

        Requirement (Simulated): Implement a simple visual on-screen "Toast" popup (using React state for notification queuing) whenever a critical alert is triggered, ensuring the user is notified even if they are busy elsewhere on the dashboard.

    Flexible Layout Saving:

        Goal: Improve widget layout flexibility beyond simple vertical reordering.

        Requirement: Replace the custom drag-and-drop move buttons with proper 2D drag-and-drop library integration (e.g., react-grid-layout) to allow resizing and free-form positioning of widgets within the grid.
        | Field | Example/Details | Status |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | Order Book Depth | Display Top 5 Bids/Asks for a symbol. | Pending |
        | Price Chart | K-Line/Candlestick chart for 100 historical points. | Pending |
        | Toast Notifications | Non-intrusive on-screen popups for critical alerts. | Pending |
        | 2D Layout/Resize | Implement react-grid-layout for resizing and free-form placement. | Pending |

IV. Technical Constraints & Context

    Platform: React with Functional Components and Hooks.

    Styling: Tailwind CSS.

    Data Persistence: Firebase Firestore (using the existing useFirebase hook and security rules).

    State Management: Local useState and useCallback for performance.

    Single-File Mandate: All code must remain within the single Dashboard.jsx file.

    Exchanges: Binance, Bybit, OKX (Public APIs only).
